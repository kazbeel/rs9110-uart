API written in C++ to handle the WiFi device RS9110-N-11-28 of Redpine Signals.

The project is based on the "Rs9110-N-22-22/24/28 Software Programming Reference Manual Version 4.15" and Firmware Version 4.7.1. Earlier versions are probably not 100% compatible with this API.

For now it is developed in Visual Studio Express 2010.

It is also necessary to have the cppunit installed in the right path.
